# XD-MVC

XD-MVC brings cross-device capabilities to MVC frameworks. 
It can be used as a plain JavaScript library. In addition, we provide an integration with Polymer (https://www.polymer-project.org).
XD-MVC consists of a server-side and a client-side part.
For communication among devices, both a peer-to-peer and a client-server version exist. You are free to choose the one that suits your needs best.
You can find three sample applications in the Examples folder: 
Two gallery applications that are built with Polymer and a maps application built with plain JavaScript.
More details on the framework can be found in the framework folder.

## Supported Browsers
The framework uses some experimental JavaScript features, hence it may not work equally well in all browsers. 
The best support is reached for Chrome.
If peer-to-peer communication is used, this is the only browser that is fully supported. 
For the client-server communication, Firefox and Safari work fairly well. For applications built with Polymer we have seen best 
results with Chrome. Internet Explorer is not supported.
